native mobile notifications for the web

## what is the goal?
our goal was to create a system that converts emails into rich native push notifications that capture the actions that are present in the email

examples:
- confirm email address would be parsed to a notification "Tap to confirm email address"
- sign up for emails when certain people tweet, buttons can be "reply | retweet | fav" that open a twitter web interface
- calendar invitations can have buttons "going | maybe | not attending"

## what was the mvp?
when you receive an email with a link, get a push notification with the subject as the text of the email and a button "go to link" that opens the link. on android

## how far did you get?
